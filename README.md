# sc2-IM-PF-pathfinding-thesis
Master thesis project. Utilizing GPU (CUDA) to create IM+PF pathfinding data, usable by multiple agents in the same environment. Mirror of https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-api

Combining the use of influence maps and potential field techniques to create novel pathfidning algorithms. Pathfinding data can be utilized by multiple agents in the same environment.
The novel algorithms are compared to A* and A*+PF in custom test suites.
